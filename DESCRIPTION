Description: The 'Homebrew Project' <brew.sh> has a myriad of "recipes" that
   make life easier for 'macOS' users by enabling them to (mostly) effortlessly
   install popular open source libraries, tools, utilities and applications.
   The project collectes anonymous metrics from users who have not opted-out
   of metrics collection and makes them available via a 'JSON' 'API'.
